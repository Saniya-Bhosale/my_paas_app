Cloud Deployment Models
Public Cloud: Services offered over the public internet.
Private Cloud: Cloud infrastructure operated for a single organization.
Hybrid Cloud: Combination of public and private clouds.
Community Cloud: Shared by several organizations with common concerns.
Federated Cloud/Intercloud
A model where multiple cloud providers interconnect to provide scalable resources across different clouds, enhancing resource sharing and reliability.
Types of Clouds
Public, Private, Hybrid, Community, Multi-cloud (using multiple providers), and Edge Cloud (processing near data sources).

Implementation Levels of Virtualization
Includes hardware virtualization, OS-level virtualization (containers), and application virtualization.
Virtualization Structures/Tools and Mechanisms
Software like VMware, Hyper-V, KVM that manage virtual machines; mechanisms include hardware-assisted virtualization and paravirtualization.
Types of Hypervisors
Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).
Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on top of an OS (e.g., VirtualBox).
Virtualization of CPU, Memory, and I/O Devices
Enables sharing and isolation of processor, RAM, and peripheral devices among multiple virtual machines.

What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows secure communication between two computers over an unsecured network. It provides a secure way to log into a remote machine and execute commands, transfer files, or manage the system, all encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
What is SCP?
SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a simple command-line tool used to securely copy files between computers on a network. SCP uses SSH to provide encryption and secure authentication during the file transfer.
Purpose: Copy files securely from one host to another.
How it works: SCP sends files over the SSH connection, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
Usage example:
bash
CopyEdit
scp /local/path/file.txt username@remote_host:/remote/path/
Advantages: Easy to use, secure because it uses SSH, no extra configuration needed if SSH is already set up.

What is SFTP?
SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure file transfer protocol that runs over SSH. Unlike SCP, SFTP provides an interactive session to manage files and directories on a remote system, supporting not only file copying but also file operations like listing directories, deleting files, and resuming interrupted transfers.
Purpose: Securely transfer files and manage remote files over SSH.
How it works: SFTP operates as a subsystem of SSH, providing a secure channel to execute file operations.
Usage example (command-line):
What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting the physical hardware and managing multiple VMs on a single physical host. It allows several operating systems to share the same hardware securely and efficiently.
Types:
Type 1 (bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V).
Type 2 (hosted): Runs on top of an existing OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).

Alternatives to SCP and SFTP for File Transfer Between VMs
Rsync: Efficiently syncs files and directories over SSH, with support for incremental transfers.
FTP/FTPS: File Transfer Protocol with or without SSL/TLS encryption; less secure than SCP/SFTP but widely supported.

What is Firebase?
Firebase is a Google-owned platform that provides backend services like real-time databases, authentication, cloud storage, and hosting for building web and mobile applications quickly and easily.
Firebase is a cloud-based platform by Google that provides developers with tools and services to build and manage web and mobile applications quickly and easily. It offers features like real-time databases, user authentication, cloud storage, hosting, and analytics, allowing developers to focus on creating app functionality without worrying about backend infrastructure. Firebase‚Äôs real-time data syncing and easy integration make it popular for building responsive, scalable apps with minimal setup.

What is Salesforce?
Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage sales, customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development.
Salesforce works as a cloud-based platform that centralizes all customer-related data‚Äîsuch as contacts, leads, and sales opportunities‚Äîsecurely in one place. It enables sales teams to efficiently track prospects, manage deals, and forecast future sales, while customer support teams use its tools to handle service requests and resolve issues. Marketing teams benefit from automation features that help run campaigns and monitor customer engagement. Additionally, Salesforce offers extensive customization options, allowing companies to tailor apps, workflows, and reports to their specific business needs. Being cloud-based, it provides users with the flexibility to access their data and tools from anywhere using a web browser or mobile app, ensuring seamless collaboration and productivity.
Imagine a company selling products:
When a customer calls, the support rep pulls up all their info instantly.
The sales team tracks the customer‚Äôs buying history and upcoming deals.
Marketing sends targeted emails based on customer behavior.
